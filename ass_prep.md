## [study guide](https://launchschool.com/lessons/56ad2094/assignments/2ec8fa4d)

### specific topics of interest:

You should be able to clearly explain the following topics:

assignments and comparison
variable scope, especially how variables interact with function definitions and blocks
function scope
hoisting
primitive values, types and type conversions/coercions
object properties and mutation
understand the differences between loose and strict equality
how passing an argument into a function may or may not permanently change the value that a variable contains or points to
working with Strings, Arrays, and Objects. In particular, you should be thoroughly familiar with the basic Array iteration methods (forEach, map, filter, and find) and how to use Object methods to access the keys and values in an Object as an Array.
understand that arrays are objects, and be able to determine whether you have an Array
variables as pointers
console.log vs return
truthiness: false and true vs. falsy and truthy
function definition and function invocation
function declarations, function expressions, and arrow functions
implicit return value of function invocations
first-class functions
partial function application
side effects
naming conventions (legal vs idiomatic)
pure functions and side effects
strict mode vs. sloppy mode
JavaScript syntactic sugar

## To do before assessment:

- Have written answers for all "specific topics of interest".
- Go through JS210 for a third time looking for gaps?
- Find more problems to solve (Mattic?)
- Attend at least 1 SPOT session.
- Look at Discussion pages for all 6 lessons.

#### Slack joke post:

I'm finding that some of the code I'm encountering has a strong tendency to become pop-culture references in my head, and I want to know if I'm not alone. For example every time I see:

```
function myFunc()
```

I immediately hear:
